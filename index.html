                    Hello! My name is Ryan Case, and I am an aspiring Web Developer. I am currently gaining experience and building my portfolio through the University of Richmond's Coding Bootcamp. My goal is to take the skills that I learn through this program, and translate it into a career in Web Development. In addition, I desire to create dynamic projects both professionally and recreationally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prior to discovering my passion for web development, I studied at Liberty University. In 2017, I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Psychology, but I had already decided I no longer desired to pursue a career in that field. It was at this point that I had to ask myself, "What are my skills, and what do I enjoy?" I came to the conclusion that due to my passion for working with software, solving problems, and creating exciting projects, Web Development was the right career for me!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I appreciate your time in reading a little about me and my journey. If interested, feel free to take a look at my portfolio. If you wish to contact me, please follow the "Contact" navigation link above.
